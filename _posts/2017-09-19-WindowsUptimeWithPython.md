title: 'Getting Windows Uptime Using Python!'
excerpt: Using Python 3.5.1 and the built in libraries, you can get the Uptime of a Windows machine.
---
Whenever I wanted to know the uptime of a Windows machine, I had to navigate to the task manager and look at the uptime in the Performane
tab. If I wanted to know the uptime for various Windows machines, then I would have to repeat this same process a few times and spend a bit
of time doing it. I wanted to speed this process up by creating a Python script to get the uptime of a Windows machine. 

The libraries that I used were:
   * subprocess
   * datetime
